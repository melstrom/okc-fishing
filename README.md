This folder contains two dta files, a do files, and survey materials. The dta files contain data on recreational fishing trips of fishing license holders living in Oklahoma City. The 'revealed preference' file contains actual fishing trip data, and the 'stated preference' file contains hypothetical fishing trips based on a choice experiment. The questions used to generate these data can be found in the survey materials. The do file contains code to estimate separate random utility maximization (RUM) models on the revealed and stated preference data, including separate welfare calculations for several hypothetical changes in fishing site quality.

To use the do file, save it and the dta files to your computer. Then open the do file and update the file paths for the dta files. Then run the do file.
